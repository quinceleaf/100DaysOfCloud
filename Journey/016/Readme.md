## Introduction

Spent today:

#### _Organizing & Planning_

- organizing my study efforts & timeline for the [AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) exam
- in preparing for the CLF and SAA exams, I've found that each training course (& instructor) I've used has its specific strengths and weaknesses.
- for the DVA I've arranged my efforts to use them in combination in a way that best works for my learning style

#### _Studying_

- basic use of the **AWS CLI** including the `--profile` flag (wish I had known that one earlier!)
- deployment strategies for **Elastic Beanstalk**
- watched AWS's [Introduction to AWS Elastic Beanstalk ](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=15878) video
- watched the EB-relevant presentations from AWS re:Invent [2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmT7QI8IIiM) & [2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4clRJuH9xU)
- began studying **Lambda**

#### _General AWS Learning_

- one daily habit I got into while preparing for the Solutions Architect certification was watching at least one case/presentation from AWS's **This is My Architecture** series ([available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb))
- this playlist (currently 500+ videos) is a fabulously rich resource for seeing how customers are finding uses for AWS's different services, and the architectures they're deploying to solve their business problems
- learning what challenges businesses face, and how their architects and teams have approached and solved their problems will hopefully provide me with insights in how overcome challenges in my own roles someday.
- the videos are about 4-8 minutes each, during which a representative of the company walks through a high-level map of their service use, what flows into what, and why they chose that architecture (or evolved previous AWS architectures to the current one)
- today watched:

  - [Miriade: Forecasting and Real Time Tracking of the Car Parking Availability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZw29_UtoU&list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb&index=56)
  - [Fundbox: Simplifying Ways to Query and Analyze Data by Different Personas - Go Serverless!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz8uXtDC1bY&list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb&index=2)
  - [New Relic: Automated Monitoring on AWS with New Relic Synthetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmhL2334GIY&list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb&index=66)
  - [AWS Solutions: Multi-Region Availability with Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and Amazon Cognito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTQ36qQF_vA&list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb&index=76)

## Next Steps
