## Introduction

Spent today:

- Reviewing **databases** (DocumentDB, Redshift, QLDB, Neptune, RDS, ElastiCache), **analytics** (Athena, Elastic Map Reduce, CloudSearch, Elasticsearch, Kinesis, QuickSight, MSK, Lake Formation, Glue) and **application integration** (AppFlow, EventBridge, MQ, SNS, SQS, StepFunctions) for my upcoming SAA exam.
- Bought a new external webcam for my upcoming certification exams – for my previous online proctored exam, the proctor didn't think it was acceptable for me to pick up and use my laptop – with its integrated webcam – to pan the room, that I could possibly be hiding something that way.
- Worked through the remainder of Tanner Linsley's [React Query Essentials](https://learn.tanstack.com/p/react-query-essentials) course.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I _plan_ to:

- continue studying for the SAA-CO2 exam
