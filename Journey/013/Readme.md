## Introduction

Spent today:

- Reviewing AWS's **Migration Services** and **Media Services** for my upcoming SAA exam.
- Decided to put off my exam for two days so that I can work through some practice tests at [A Cloud Guru](https://bit.ly/2Q17K5c) and [Digital Cloud Training](https://bit.ly/2Eb1t4a), since friends have recommended both very highly.
- I didn't take any practice tests before my CCP exam, and I feel it would be better working through some questions to identify any last-minute deficiencies to focus on.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I _plan_ to:

- take several practice tests for the SAA-C02 exam
