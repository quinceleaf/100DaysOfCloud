## Introduction

Spent today:

- Studying for SAA exam

- took my first practice exam with [Digital Cloud Training](https://bit.ly/2Eb1t4a), scored 86%.

- Not a bad score for a practice exam, but not in the range I'm aiming for just yet.

- Definitely could improve over this, several questions I knew that I didn't know the answer (as opposed to thinking I knew the answer, and being incorrect).

- Kudos to [Digital Cloud Training](https://bit.ly/2Eb1t4a)'s in-depth explanations (complete with diagrams where relevant) for each question, walking through what the correct response was, why each other response was incorrect, and links to AWS Documentation and DCT's own training materials for further information.

- This provides excellent support for figuring out how you approached the problem from the wrong angle, and what to watch out for next time.

- Need to review more scenarios involving **Kinesis & alternative choices** and **choosing between content delivery architectures**.

Just time for several more dry runs before tomorrow's real one!

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I _plan_ to:

- take several more practice tests for the SAA-C02 exam
- take the exam (proctored scheduling permitting)
