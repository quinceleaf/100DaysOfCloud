## Introduction

Spent today:

#### _Studying_

- studied **Serverless Application Model** and began studying/working with the AWS developer tools suite (**CodeCommit**, **CodeDeploy**, **CodePipeline** and **CodeStar**)

#### _General AWS Learning_

- took AWS's newly launched [Introduction to Blockchain](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=56095) course
- my interest in blockchain applications comes from studying supply chain and logistics over the past 3 years, and the strong interest about blockchain (if little actual deployment, yet) of a lot of companies in those sectors.
- watched 2 epis of AWS's [This is My Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb) series.

## Next Steps

- continuing to prepare for the Developer Associate exam
