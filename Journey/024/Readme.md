## Today

- Continued working with Next.js on the frontend for my MES project

- Almost completed work on the #CloudGuruChallenge for October 2020, **Event-Driven Python on AWS**

- Was dismayed to discover, only after building the ETL pipeline to DynamoDB, that Quicksight does not support it as a data source

- Also discovered Quicksight is not free but merely offers a 2-month trial. And while there is one data visualization service out there that **does** connect to DynamoDB – [Redash.io](https://redash.io/) – it too only offers a 60-day trial.

- I would prefer a longer-term option that I could then offer as an example of my work in my portfolio. I then added API Gateway and additional Lambda functions to my SAM template so that the ETL'ed dataset could be called from a dashboard I would build myself.

- Learned a lot while working to get [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) & [react-chartsjs-2](http://jerairrest.github.io/react-chartjs-2/) to display the data. I like the results so far, just need to finish a minor change so that the dashboard is usable on smaller screen sizes (within reason).

- For more information on the challenge, see [Forrest Brazeal's](https://github.com/forrestbrazeal) original post on the [A Cloud Guru blog](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cloudguruchallenge-python-aws-etl)
