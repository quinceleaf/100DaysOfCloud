## Introduction

Spent today:

- studying/reviewing _Identity and Access Management_ & _S3_ for my upcoming Solutions Architect – Associate exam, including the various documentation pages, whitepapers and guides
- reading Tomasz Łakomy's latest [blog post](), which inspired me to finally take the time to work through his excellent and informative [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) course [Build an App with the AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-app-with-the-aws-cloud-development-kit).
- look forward to getting some time to play around and explore the CDK after the SAA exam, I've read a lot of excited posts and tweets about how useful people are finding it.
- didn't yet revisit the problems I was experiencing yesterday with the mysterious "Missing Authentication Token" response when I called any endpoint of my new API Gateway outside of the console (calling them in either the API Gateway method test pages or the various Lambda test pages generates no errors).

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I _plan_ to:

- resolve the authorization problem and finish setting up API Gateway
- continue studying for the SAA-CO2 exam
