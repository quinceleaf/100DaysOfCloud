## Introduction

Spent today:

- Reviewing **the Well-Architected Framework** (again) and **AWS Cognito** for my upcoming SAA exam.
- Will be using Cognito in my personal DynamoDB project, when I get back to it after the exam.
- Watched the latest episode of [DynamoDB Office Hours with Rick Houlihan](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/710404761), where he focuses on translating existing relational databases into DynamoDB.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I _plan_ to:

- continue studying for the SAA-CO2 exam
