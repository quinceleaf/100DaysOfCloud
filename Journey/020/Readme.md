## Today

- Worked on my MES project

### Data Modeling and DynamoDB

- Completed a first cut at the data model for the project, and compiled a mock data set to use while debugging Lambda functions and beginning work on the frontend.

- So far, I've been able to set up DynamoDB as a single table, which is pretty crazy for this type of project. I might have to revisit this decision later, but for now I will continue down this path.

### SAM/CloudFormation IaC

- Set up a base template to use as I proceed to the stage of authoring (and revising) the Lambda functions of this project.

- I had used the console for working on the set of Lambdas for all the routes for my [Cloud Calendar](https://github.com/quinceleaf/cloud-calendar) project. This method certainly works, but there are some drawbacks. As this was my first major Lambda-based project, I learned from making and correctly a lot of mistakes. However, all of this extra code tweaking required extra attention to make sure that the revisions and bug fixes were consistently applied to both the versions on my laptop and the deployed version.

- Using SAM, I can work exclusively on my local version and then deploy from that version, which I anticipate will eliminate a lot of the extra effort.
