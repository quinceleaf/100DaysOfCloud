## Introduction

Spent today:

- Reviewing **CloudFormation** for my upcoming SAA exam.
- I'll be taking the SAA exam early next week (was originally planning to take this Sunday, but there is IKEA furniture to assemble ðŸ˜‚) and following up with the Developer Associate (DA) exam by September.

Upcoming plans:

- Inspired by Matt Coulter's [DEV.to](https://dev.to) blog post [CDK Patterns at 20! Let's Walk Through all 20 Serverless Patterns for AWS](https://dev.to/nideveloper/cdk-patterns-at-20-let-s-walk-through-all-20-serverless-patterns-for-aws-d1n), I began reviewing the design patterns catalogued at [CDK Patterns](https://cdkpatterns.com/index.html) and sketching out project ideas.
- I'm planning to design 4 or 5 projects built on/incorporating the patterns presented above.
- My entire time as a developer has been spent _using code_ to _solve specific and immediate business problems_. So I'm aiming to set up these projects to solve business needs and challenges within the supply chain/logistics, food tech or hospitality industries, as examples.
- For each project, I will write a series of tutorials and make them available as blog posts and/or a series of videos.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I _plan_ to:

- continue studying for the SAA-CO2 exam
