# Studying for my Solutions Architect Certification

## Today's Progress

- Today was my first day participating in the [#100DaysOfCloud](https://100daysofcloud.com) challenge, although I've been focusing on AWS and the cloud since the beginning of June. I successfully passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam on July 2nd.

- Spent most of the day studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02) exam. I had originally planned on attempting the exam at the end of August but have moved up my timeline by two weeks. I will be following this certification with the Certified Developer - Associate. Why? The balance of theoretical vs practical knowledge is weighted much heavier towards practical for the developer exam, and since I will more frequently be working on applied projects for the #100DaysOfCloud and for my personal portfolio, it makes sense to get the SAA exam out of the way earlier and devote a longer, more focused block to prepping for the DA exam.

- Started working through the video lessons of the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) 2020](https://www.exampro.co/aws-exam-solutions-architect-associate) course at [ExamPro](http://www.exampro.co). Andrew Brown has a lot of useful tips and suggestions for how to approach and think about the AWS topics that will be covered in specific depth for this exam. The site also has preparation courses on Azure and Oracle Cloud certifications, if that's of interest to you.

- Covered the lessons on storage (S3, Snowball) and networking (VPC).

- Future progress posts will tackle specific projects or present a review of a topic as a mini-tutorial. I'm excited to do so! Currently I'm working on projects using DynamoDB, Cognito and Boto3 (the Python SDK for AWS), so I'll definitely be turning some of my learning into tutorials and step-by-step micro-projects.
