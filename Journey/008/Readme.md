## Introduction

Spent today:

- Continued reviewing **EC2**, **CloudWatch** and the various filesystem options for EC2 instances (EBS vs EFS vs FSx)
- Worked through first half of Tanner Linsley's [React Query Essentials](https://learn.tanstack.com/p/react-query-essentials) course. He's done an amazing job with [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query), an easy-to-use, powerful suite of hooks for fetching, caching and working with asynchronous data in React applications. Look forward to putting it to use in my frontend, consuming the AWS APIs I just finished setting up.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I _plan_ to:

- continue studying for the SAA-CO2 exam
